        <h2 data-magellan-destination="about">About Devpost</h2>
        <a name="about"></a>

        <p>Devpost is the home for hackers and we help developers find fulfilling work. You probably know us from the hackathon scene, where we power the majority of the world&rsquo;s college, high school, and civic hackathons. We also help organizations like <a href="http://gearapp.devpost.com/" target="_blank">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://vrjam.devpost.com/" target="_blank">Oculus</a>, and <a href="http://uberhackathon.devpost.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a> reach more developers through online hackathons.</p>

        <p><a href="/2015.html">Last summer we released our first student hacker report</a>, which ranked technologies &amp; APIs used at student hackathons during the 2014&ndash;2015 academic year.</p>

        <h2 data-magellan-destination="methodology">Survey methodology</h2>
        <a name="methodology"></a>

        <p>During the 2016 spring hackathon season, we surveyed U.S. student developers (college, high school, and bootcampers) to learn how they felt about job hunting and their future careers. We hope our findings and recommendations will encourage hiring managers, recruiters, and HR to be more productive and help them attract better hires. Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@devpost.com">info@devpost.com</a> if you have any feedback or questions.</p>

        <p>To improve response rates, we incorporated survey questions into our hackathon submission flow. Every week, we asked students to answer 3&ndash;4 questions about recruiting when submitting their projects.</p>

        <p>Afterwards, we scrubbed PII, excised erroneous data, and analyzed it in Excel. Sample size was small for most questions, so while we can&rsquo;t claim statistical significance, we do believe our conclusions reflect the mood of student developers in the United States.</p>

        <h2 data-magellan-destination="devswant">What developers want</h2>
        <a name="devswant"></a>

        <h3 data-magellan-destination="careersjobs" class="no-margin-top">A strong relationship, but not a marriage</h3>
        <a name="careersjobs"></a>
        <p>The first thing we asked was whether students were looking for &ldquo;careers&rdquo; vs &ldquo;jobs.&rdquo; We figured that the word career might not carry the same cachet it did for earlier generations.</p>

        <p>83% of students said they were looking for fulfilling careers rather than jobs, but they also showed us that a modern career doesn&rsquo;t mean what it used to.</p>

        <p>Students said that, on average, they planned to stay for 2.9 years at their next full-time job and for just over 5 months at internships.</p>

        <p>Later in the season, we revised the question to ask how long students expected to stay, on average, at <em>any</em> job. The predicted tenure averaged just over 5 years with a median of 4 years. We think it&rsquo;s fair to say that even later on in their careers, today&rsquo;s students will stay mobile.</p>

        <h3 data-magellan-destination="culture">People are the key to culture</h3>
        <a name="culture"></a>
        <p>Developers care more about your team than your perks. It&rsquo;s easy to fix a broken ping pong table, but it&rsquo;s not so easy to fix a broken development team.</p>

        <p>Here are the top 5 things students want know about their future colleagues before accepting an offer:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>How well they interact with each other</li>
          <li>Favorite part of their jobs</li>
          <li>Skills &amp; background</li>
          <li>Hobbies / interests outside of work</li>
          <li>General personality</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We think it&rsquo;s in a company&rsquo;s best interest to be transparent and make this information available to all job seekers. Most students can&rsquo;t get a handle on this unless they interview in person, and even then, they may only speak with 1 or 2 employees.</p>

        <p>Speaking of, how many people do students need to meet at a company before feeling comfortable enough to accept an offer? 45% said 1&ndash;3 and 34% reported 3&ndash;5. Returns diminish quickly after that.</p>

        <p>When we asked students to rank the following job attributes: people, learning, company culture, and making an impact&mdash;people came out on top and many commented that, to them, people and culture were the same thing.</p>

        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> your developers are the best recruiting asset you&rsquo;ve got. Get them involved and in front of developers whenever you can: career fairs, phone screens, interviews, conference talks, etc.</p>

        <h3 data-magellan-destination="learning">Experience &amp; learning</h3>
        <a name="learning"></a>
        <p>Developers, especially students, are eager to learn. It&rsquo;s the most important thing they&rsquo;ll do at their internships and first job.</p>

        <p>We asked students to tell us, in their own words, what they hoped to get out of a 10&ndash;12 week internship. We've grouped &amp; ranked their responses below:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Learning</li>
          <li>Experience</li>
          <li>New skills</li>
          <li>Networking</li>
          <li>Making an impact</li>
        </ol>

        <p>And what did they want to learn?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How to do a good job (best practices and how write code well)</li>
          <li>Specific technologies (languages, frameworks, concepts, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>38% even said learning was more important than compensation when comparing internship offers. Of course, <a href="#internsalary">you should definitely be paying your interns</a>. 😁

        <h3 data-magellan-destination="compensation">Appropriate compensation</h3>
        <a name="compensation"></a>
        <p>Compensation can be an uncomfortable topic no matter who you are, how much experience you have, or where you are in the recruiting process. But, student developers are keenly aware of their high earning potential and want to know about compensation early on.</p>

        <p>The majority of students said they expect to earn between $70–150K right out of school.<!-- That matches the range from <a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/4fd947de/Entry-Level" target="_blank">Payscale.com&rsquo;s national survey of developer salaries</a>.--></p>

        <!-- salary chart goes here -->
        <!--<div style="max-width:600px;">-->
          <canvas id="salary_chart" width="400" height="250"></canvas>
        <!--</div>-->

        <p>We also asked students to think forward 5 years. <!--We&rsquo;ve charted their paired salary expectations. Initial salary is plotted on the x-axis and future salary ranges are clustered on the Y axis.</p>

        <p>-->Students expected their salaries to go up by $20-30K within their first 5 years on the job. High earners (starting at over $150K) expected to jump by $50K or more.</p>

        <!-- second salary chart goes here -->
        <!--<div style="max-width:600px;">
          <canvas id="raise_chart" width="400" height="250"></canvas>
        </div>-->

        <p>A 40% jump over 5 years ($50k -> $70K) may sound extreme outside the tech industry, but today&rsquo;s students are in high demand and their expectations reflect it.</p>

        <p>For all the founders, we also asked students how much they valued company equity. It was definitely important, but not a must have&mdash;so don't place too much emphasis on options over cash.</p>

        <!-- equity pie chart goes here -->
        <div style="text-align:center;">

        <h2 data-magellan-destination="recruiting">Developer recruiting</h2>
        <a name="recruiting"></a>
        <p>When we asked about recruiting, 3 problem areas emerged:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Difficulty finding desirable job opportunities due to lack of information</li>
          <li>Job applications don't represent applicants effectively</li>
          <li>Interviews are stressful and unproductive</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 data-magellan-destination="opportunities" class="no-margin-top">Finding opportunities</h3>
        <a name="opportunities"></a>
        <p>Job listings are an important part of recruiting. They should tell you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Who the hiring company is</li>
          <li>What they do</li>
          <li>Which roles they are hiring for</li>
          <li>What will someone in this role actually do</li>
          <li>What types of experience / education do you need to succeed in this role</li>
          <li>How to apply / get more information</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additionally, a company&rsquo;s career site should tell you:

          <ul>
            <li>About the people who work there</li>
            <li>The types of work the company does</li>
            <li>Employment benefits</li>
            <li>Company culture</li>
            <li>How it operates</li>
          </ul>

        <p>When we asked what kinds of information were missing from job descriptions and career sites, the top 6 responses were:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Description of company culture</li>
          <li>Pay / compensation</li>
          <li>Job duties &amp; responsibilities</li>
          <li>Experience / education requirements</li>
          <li>Company / employee contact info</li>
          <li>Description of what company does / type of projects</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So yeah, job descriptions and career sites are failing at their one job.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/damn-it-cup-you-have-one-job.jpeg" style="max-height:300px"></p>

        <p>According to students, career fairs and word of mouth are the most popular ways to look for jobs. We feel that there&rsquo;s a lot of room for improvement here. Not every organization can send a recruiter (or ideally 2&ndash;3 developers) on-site.

        <p>Hackathons, especially college events, are a great venue for reaching student developers. 68% of students said they had looked for jobs at a hackathon. A mid-size event can bring in 100–200 students. On the high end, PennApps and MHacks have hit up to 1,400.

        <h3 data-magellan-destination="applying">Applying</h3>
        <a name="applying"></a>
        <p>What do students like least about job hunting? 42% pointed towards cover letters &amp; resumes and 25% said behavioral &amp; technical interviews.</p>

        <p>We dug in to learn what the most important part of a resume was:</p>

        <div class="percent-rank">
          <p><strong>34.5%</strong> Projects</p>
          <p><strong>33.2%</strong> Experience (internships, jobs, research)</p>
          <p><strong>9.03%</strong> Skillset</p>
          <p><strong>7.74%</strong> Organizations (activities, events, hobbies, etc.)</p>
          <p><strong>6.45%</strong> Personality (attitude, passion, leader, etc)</p>
          <p><strong>5.48%</strong> Hackathon involvement</p>
          <p><strong>3.55%</strong> Education / degrees / GPA</p>
        </div>

        <p>Past projects and experience top the list, suggesting that devs are interested in letting their actual work speak for them.</p>

        <p>Next, we asked what a cover letter should convey:</p>

        <div class="percent-rank">
          <p><strong>46%</strong> Passion / energy / interest / desire</p>
          <p><strong>35%</strong> Your skills / qualifications / accomplishments</p>
          <p><strong>20%</strong> Why you&rsquo;re the best candidate</p>
          <p><strong>18%</strong> Why you are applying</p>
          <p><strong>17%</strong> Introduce yourself</p>
          <p><strong>17%</strong> Personality</p>
          <p><strong>11%</strong> How you can contribute</p>
          <p><strong>9%</strong> Past experience</p>
          <p><strong>8%</strong> Understanding of company</p>
          <p><strong>3%</strong> Things not included on resume</p>
          <p><strong>2%</strong> Education</p>
        </div>

        <p>We&rsquo;re not surprised that &ldquo;passion&rdquo; topped the list. With limited professional experience coming out of school, it&rsquo;s a students&rsquo; biggest asset. But it&rsquo;s also a cop-out. Identifying how you can contribute in this role, why you&rsquo;re the best candidate, and linking your understanding of the business to your own experience / abilities is, in our opinion, a much better approach.</p>

        <p>So, what do developers want employers to know about them&mdash;things that couldn&rsquo;t be conveyed in a cover letter or resume? A slew of behavioral tropes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Passion for computer science</li>
          <li>Being a quick learner</li>
          <li>Personal work ethic</li>
          <li>Flexibility</li>
          <li>Sense of humor</li>
          <li>Hunger for challenges</li>
        </ul>

        <p>How long a cover letter should be?</p>

        <div class="percent-rank">
          <p><strong>33%</strong> 1 page</p>
          <p><strong>18%</strong> Other / as long as it needs to be</p>
          <p><strong>15%</strong> 1-2 pages</p>
          <p><strong>11%</strong> 2-3 paragraphs</p>
          <p><strong>7%</strong> A few sentences</p>
          <p><strong>7%</strong> half a page</p>
          <p><strong>6%</strong> 1 paragraph</p>
          <p><strong>4%</strong> 2/3-3/4 page</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Yikes on bikes!</strong> No wonder students hate cover letters, they&rsquo;re trying to write novels. In our opinion, you can write a compelling cover letter in 6 sentences&ndash;2 paragraphs.</p>

        <p>So, what would make writing cover letters easier?</p>

        <div class="percent-rank">
          <p><strong>29%</strong> Standard format / automation tool / examples</p>
          <p><strong>19%</strong> Practice / training</p>
          <p><strong>18%</strong> Better info on company / job</p>
          <p><strong>16%</strong> Other</p>
          <p><strong>8%</strong> Not having to write a cover letter</p>
          <p><strong>7%</strong> Feeling qualified / confidence</p>
          <p><strong>5%</strong> Interest in company</p>
          <p><strong>2%</strong> Peer review</p>
        </div>

        <p>These answers are the most telling of all. Students don&rsquo;t know how to write proper cover letters because nobody is teaching them, they aren&rsquo;t getting enough practice, and because they haven&rsquo;t seen any great examples.</p>

        <p>Finally, how do students feel about applying to jobs via applicant tracking systems like Monster, Jobscore, and Greenhouse?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Too time consuming</li>
          <li>Job posts are often out of date / already filled</li>
          <li>They are cumbersome and duplicate information / tasks</li>
          <li>No way to apply to lots of jobs all at once</li>
          <li>Platforms lean too heavily on resumes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> students don&rsquo;t want to define themselves on two sheets of paper or an online form. They&rsquo;re looking for a simple way to connect with employers and use their actual work to represent their capabilities. Perhaps it's time to reinvent the résumé.</p>


        <h3 data-magellan-destination="interviewing">Interviewing</h3>
        <a name="interviewing"></a>
        <p>Developers typically face two types of interviews: technical and behavioral. They might be live &amp; in-person or remote via Skype / Hangouts. Technical interviews can include whiteboard problem solving, logic questions, pairing sessions, or even a take home exercise. There&rsquo;s no one-true-way to do interviews, but there does seem to be one-true-attitude toward them:</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/6DAfAmtBOggLu/giphy.gif" style="max-height:300px"></p>

        <p>Students reported that <strong>anxiety was their least favorite part of interviewing</strong>, followed by:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Irrelevant questions</li>
          <li>Post interview suspense &amp; waiting for response</li>
          <li>Answering questions (technical, behavior, and <em>any</em>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That sounded a bit dramatic, so we asked if they preferred technical interviews or take-home coding exercises to demonstrate their skills. 65% said they&rsquo;d prefer a take home coding project. Only 30% chose the interview.</p>

        <p>Students said a take home project is more representative of a real-world assignment, less stressful, and allows them to focus.</p>

        <p>Proponents of technical interviews preferred the social interaction and the opportunity to demonstrate their problem solving skills and process in real-time.</p>

        <p>So, on one hand, developers want an opportunity to show their true personality, but they&rsquo;re also petrified of potentially stressful confrontations. Consider informing interview candidates of what to expect and how to prepare.</p>

        <h2 data-magellan-destination="insights">Today&rsquo;s student developer</h2>
        <a name="insights"></a>
        <p>Software developers are in demand and today&rsquo;s students are acutely aware of their value in the marketplace. They&rsquo;re interested in learning from and developing a strong working relationship with colleagues, but will probably not begin and end at the same company.</p>

        <p>When assessing a company&rsquo;s &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; students are actually talking about the people.  And they also expect to get paid well, with above average growth in compensation.</p>

        <p>Students are eager to enter the workforce, but find the process stressful and cumbersome. It&rsquo;s hard to convey their best traits in resumes or cover letters, because they have limited experience marketing themselves professionally. Additionally, job listings and career sites fail to convey what&rsquo;s important to developers and the application process is riddled with repetitive / inefficient steps.</p>

        <p>Interviews are a source of anxiety, likely due to irrelevant questions that don&rsquo;t reflect “real life” problem solving.</p>
